# Dex
An open source self balancing robot designed for the Raspberry Pi Pico and controlled by a DS4 controller. Dex was made with 3D printed ABS, a custom PCB, and a whole lot of patience. This repository shall serve as a guide for anyone to reference for their own balancing robot. The code is well formatted for your convenience you nerd. Note this is an intermediate project so take your time and have fun.

## Software
This project uses the several libraries including FreeRTOS, BTstack, and the Pico SDK. Each is a specific versions and can be setup with a recursive git clone. For this project the software utilizes both cores on the RP2040.

### Core 0
The primary purpose of core 0 is to handle all of the CWY43 SPI and MPU6050 I2C interrupts that hog all the cpu.

### Core 1
The FreeRTOS scheduler runs on this core to prevent conflicting timing with the SPI interrupted. The bluetooth callback also gets processed here. 

| FreeRTOS Scheduler Tasks | Description | Task Delay us |
| ----- | ---- | ---- |
| stat_led_task | blinky blinky | 500000us |
| bt_hid_inputs | process controller inputs | 20000us |
| stepper_left_task | controls the left stepper | varying per step |
| stepper_right_task | controls the right stepper | varying per step  |
| mpu6050_task | requests gyro/accelerometer data and processed roll angle with Kalman filter | 20000us |
| pid_task | calculates the output for the stepper motors | 10000us |
| good_boy_task | watches the dog | 500000us |

### Overclocking
Please note this project overclock the RP2040 to 250MHz and configures the configTICK_RATE_HZ 100000 (10us period). This is to give enough time for the schedule overhead. The reason for the high tick rate is because the steppers need step at very high rates.

## PCB 
This PCB was made in Eagle Cad and can find the PCB under resources/pcb. Please note there are two mistakes that i've hand wired for this current pcb. The holes for the switch are too small and cut traces to make the switch come before the 5V regulator. I'll update the files with a fixed design soon.

## Known Issues
Sometimes the program will halt when trying to connect to the BT HID.



## Starting Debugger
Plug in debugger and run:
```
openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -c "adapter speed 5000" -f target/rp2040.cfg -s tcl
```
confrim this starts on localhost:3333

open another terminal and run:
```
gdb-multiarch dex.elf
```
in this termincal type the command
```
target remote localhost:3333
```
load with 
```
load
